  "title": "Release Lock File Specification",
  "description": " This document defines the specification for the **Release Lock File**.  The release lock file provides metadata about the package and in most cases should provide sufficient information about the packaged contracts and its dependencies to do bytecode verification of its contracts.\n ## Guiding Principles\n \n The release lock file specification makes the following assumptions about the\n document lifecycle.\n \n 1. Release lock files are intended to be generated programatically by package management software as part of the release process.\n 2. Release lock files will be consumed by package managers during tasks like installing package dependencies or building and deploying new releases.\n 3. Release lock files will typically **not** be stored alongside the source, but rather by package registries *or* referenced by package registries and stored in something akin to IPFS.\n \n \n## Format\n \n The canonical format for the package manifest is a JSON document containing a\n single JSON object.  \n \n \n## Filename\n \n Convention is to name this document `<version>.lock` where the `<version>`\n component is the full version string for the release.\n \n Package managers which are installing dependencies for development versions\n should keep their own version of this document under the lowercased name of the\n package manager such as `truffle.lock` or `dapple.lock`.  This file would\n typically be excluded from version control.\n \n \n## Document Specification\n \n The following fields are defined for the release lock file.  Custom fields may\n be included.  Custom fields **should** be prefixed with `x-` to prevent name\n collisions with future versions of the specification.\n ",
