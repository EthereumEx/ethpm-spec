  "description": "This document defines the specification for the **Package Manifest**. The\n package manifest contains meta data about the package as well as dependencies\n needed for installation of the package.\n \n \n## Guiding Principles\n \nThe package manifest specification makes the following assumptions about the\n document lifecycle.\n \n1. Package manifests are long lived documents that will be modified regularly\n2. Package manifests will primarily be consumed by package managers.\n3. Package manifests will primarily be used by package indexes to popululate basic package metadata.\n2. Package Managers will typically be used to assist in the creation and modification of Package Manifest documents.\n4. Package Manifest documents will occasionally be created and modified manually by people.\n4. Package manifests will typically be stored alongised the package source code.\n \n \n## Format\n \n The canoonical format for the package manifest is a JSON document containing a\n single JSON object.\n \n \n## Filename\n \n Convention is to name this document `epm.json` which is short for *'ethereum\n package manifest'*.\n \n \n## Document Specification\n \n The following fields are defined for the package manifest.  Custom fields may\n be included.  Custom fields **should** be prefixed with `x-` to prevent name\n collisions with future versions of the specification.\nThis document defines the specification for the Package Manifest. The package manifest contains meta data about the package as well as dependencies needed for installation of the package.",
